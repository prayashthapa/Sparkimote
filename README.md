**Sparkimote** is a web-interface that communicates with Sparki. It can communicate with Sparki either via USB Serial or Bluetooth Serial. Follow the instructions below to get started with controlling Sparki through your browser!

- clone the repo and cd into it via Terminal
- run ```npm install``` to install dependencies
- upload ```sparki/sparki.ino``` to Sparki
- run ```node server/index.js``` (ensure that the serial ports match depending on comm. type):
	- ```/dev/cu.ArcBotics-DevB``` for Bluetooth (pair via Bluetooth Settings in System Preferences)
	- ```/dev/tty.usbmodemXXXX``` for USB
- visit ```http://localhost:8080```
- fire away!

###### Note: If you want to use USB Serial Communication instead, replace all instances of ```Serial1``` inside of sparki/sparki.ino with ```Serial```!
